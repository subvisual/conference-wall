  talk: Software Design in the 21st Century
  abstract: In the last decade or so we've seen a number of new ideas added to the mix to help us effectively design our software. Patterns help us capture the solutions and rationale for using them. Refactoring allows us to alter the design of a system after the code is written. Agile methods, in particular Extreme Programming, give us a highly iterative and evolutionary approach which is particularly well suited to changing requirements and environments. Martin Fowler has been a leading voice in these techniques and will give a suite of short talks featuring various aspects about his recent thinking about how these and other developments affect our software development.

  talk: Methods of Memory Management in MRI
  abstract: "Let's talk about MRI's GC! In this talk we will cover memory management algorithms in MRI. We will cover how objects are allocated and how they are freed. We will start by looking at Ruby's memory layout, including page allocation and object allocations within those pages. Next we'll cover collection algorithms used by MRI starting with the mark and sweep algorithm, followed by generational collection, and the tri color abstraction. Finally we'll cover experimental developments for the GC like heap splitting. Expect to leave this talk with heaps of pointers to add to your remembered set!"
