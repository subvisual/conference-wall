  talk: "Let's Work Together!"
  abstract: >
    Nobody works alone in a vacuum, and successful work hinges on how well a
    team communicates and collaborates with each other. This talk will explore
    many methods, tools, and techniques teams use to produce great web
    experiences. How do front-end development teams make sure they write clean
    and consistent code together? How do designers ensure colors, typography,
    and other design elements are used correctly? What deliverables should be
    created in an effective web design process? How are decisions communicated
    with the team, stakeholders, and the broader organization? There are no
    “right” answers to these questions, but this talk will cover some important
    principles and helpful tactics to help your team make great work together.

  talk: "What's Your Roadmap?"
  abstract: >
    A product roadmap is not a release plan, nor a Gantt chart, so why do so
    many product teams conflate the two? Using case studies and personal
    experience, this talk walks through what a roadmaps is and how teams can
    leverage them for a successful product future.

  talk: "Home"
  abstract: >
    “Home” is a talk about users’ digital life and designers’ roles in shaping
    them for the best. Home, understood as “the place where one lives
    permanently as a member of a household” is no longer a physical space for a
    vast group of people. Many of us find comfort in digital environments and
    use them for work and leisure and sometimes support.This talk aims to dig
    deeper into that relationship over time and discuss the key factors that
    will help designers keep and improve that connection between their products
    and their users.

  talk: Web Performance Kinetosis
  abstract: >
    Kinetosis, commonly known as motion sickness, is a condition in which a
    disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular
    system’s sense of movement. Similarly, the way you think your website moves
    may be radically different from what your audience is actually
    experiencing.

  talk: "How to Tell When You're Tired"
  abstract: >
    The most famous story about work comes from Greek myth: Sisyphus woke each
    morning to push a rock up a mountain, then the next day found the rock back
    at the bottom, his progress gone and the challenge reset. After 20 years of
    making websites, his story sounds familiar to me. If expertise is
    impossible because everything changes so frequently, how does a person
    develop wisdom about their work? How do you not burn out? Are these silly
    questions? Maybe, but change begins with diligent effort and a new
    perspective on the work.

  talk: "Design for Emotion"
  abstract: >
    If you're a designer in 2017, chances are you fully integrate data and KPI
    in your daily life. That being said, if design’s first role is all about
    solving issues and making everybody's life easier through on point and
    smart decisions, we, at the very core of our human nature, are totally
    illogical and emotion-driven creatures. Let's break things, do a bit of
    neuroscience, and explore a painting-inspired take on the interactive
    design process.

  talk: "Evaluating Technology"
  abstract: >
    We work with technology every day. And every day it seems like there’s more
    and more technology to understand: graphic design tools, build tools,
    frameworks and libraries, not to mention new HTML, CSS and JavaScript
    features landing in browsers. How should we best choose which technologies to
    invest our time in? When we decide to weigh up the technology choices that
    confront us, what are the best criteria for doing that? This talk will help
    you evaluate tools and technologies in a way that best benefits the people
    who use the websites that we are designing and developing. Let’s take a look
    at some of the hottest new web technologies like service workers and web
    components. Together we will dig beneath the hype to find out whether they
    will really change life on the web for the better.

  talk: "Solving layout problems with CSS Grid and friends"
  abstract: >
    CSS Grid Layout launched into the majority of our browsers in 2017. As
    designers and developers have started to use Grid I’ve been answering a lot
    of questions about the specification. In this talk I’ll answer some of the
    common questions about Grid Layout in production - from dealing with old
    browsers to what might come next in CSS for layout. There will be plenty of
    practical tips for you to use in your projects today.

  talk: "The <svg> of .svg"
  abstract: >
    Scalable Vector Graphics, or Documents? Both. SVG may be known more as an
    image format, perfect for displaying icons and illustrations, including
    animated ones. But there are other aspects of SVG that make it as powerful
    as it is, and those aspects stem from its nature as a document format, as
    well as its graphical nature. In this talk, Sara is going to highlight some
    SVG's document side and show you how it can be leveraged to improve and
    optimize the way we deliver content such as text and images for the Web,
    including SVG itself.

  talk: "A Little Story About A Big Bang Redesign (Smashing Magazine’s 2017 Relaunch, a Case Study"
  abstract: >
    You’ve been there: big bang redesigns are usually a very, very bad idea.
    Redesigning and rebuilding an existing website from scratch is risky and
    unpredictable, and in many cases the level of complexity is highly
    underrated and underestimated. In mid-2016, Smashing Magazine has decided
    to make a big switch from the existing WordPress setup to an entirely new
    design, entirely new architecture (JAM Stack) and an entirely new,
    GitHub-based, editorial workflow.  In this talk, Vitaly Friedman,
    editor-in-chief and co-founder of Smashing Magazine, will share some of the
    insights into Smashing Magazine’s Relaunch in 2017 — with decisions made,
    failures, successes, lessons learned and shady’n'dirty techniques used
    along the way. Among other things, you’ll learn how Smashing Magazine uses
    HTTP/2, service workers and server-less architecture with static site
    generators to boost performance, with a dash of React, Preact, CSS Grid,
    calc(), a bit dirty CSS and the peek into the new GitHub-based editorial
    workflow here and there. Beware: the session will contain at least 27
    illustrations of cats!  Keep in mind: you won’t be able to unsee the things
    you’ll see in this session. Yes, it’s going to be dirty, tricky and
    horribly annoying at times. You’ll leave with a toolbox of practical
    techniques that you’ll be able to apply to your work right away. And
    potentially some tips for saving money on airfare, too!
